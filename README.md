## Left to do:

### Big Problems:
* CSS should probably be redone in SASS, cleaned up
* Use Mustache (or some other templating engine) to compile, it's getting a bit disorganized
* Accessibility pass beyond just using WAVE tools
* Pixel breakpoints for mobile are more predictable... may need 3 sizes, but switch it over.

### Small Problems:
* Add lightbox for major projects too
* Standard screenshot size
* Create medium-size screenshots for major projects
* Consider lazy load on _all_ images
