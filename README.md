Portfolio page.

Built with Jekyll.

## Left to do:

### Big Tasks:
* CSS is partially redone in .scss files but is not quite where I want it.
* Accessibility pass beyond just using WAVE tools
* Pixel breakpoints for mobile are more predictable... may need 3 sizes, but switch it over.

### Small Tasks:
* Add lightbox for major projects too
* Standard screenshot size
* Create medium-size screenshots for major projects
* Consider lazy load on _all_ images
