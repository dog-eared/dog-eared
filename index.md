title: About Me
---

Hi! I'm a software developer largely focused on backend development using Symfony and PHP 8. I'm a collaborative and adaptable team-player with a background in live theatre and arts leadership. In 2020, I graduated from the _Software Development_ program at [Mohawk College](https://mohawkcollege.ca), and I hold a degree in _Dramatic Arts_ from [Brock University](https://brocku.ca). 

I'm currently working at [Race Roster](https://www.raceroster.com), a leading platform connecting competitive race organizers to registrants. Previously, I worked at [Audiobooks.com](https://www.audiobooks.com) with a focus on improvements to customer tracking and automating product recommendations. I also worked on _Outcome_ and _Outcome Campus Connect_ as part of the UX team at [Orbis Communications](https://www.orbiscommunications.com), focusing on accessibility and usability for software used by 100+ post-secondary institutions across North America.
