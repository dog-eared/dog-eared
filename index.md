title: About Me
---

I am an adaptable software developer with over three years of experience encompassing back-end work (PHP 8 and Symfony, C# and .NET), databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and a little front-end work when I get the opportunity (Vanilla JS, Vue.js, a11y compliance). I'm at my best doing back-end work, translating complex business needs into simple, straightforward code; but I'm more than willing to step in and pick up the slack wherever my team needs it.

I'm currently working at [Race Roster](https://www.raceroster.com), a leading platform connecting competitive race organizers to registrants. Previously, I worked at [Audiobooks.com](https://www.audiobooks.com) with a focus on improvements to customer tracking and automating product recommendations. I also worked on _Outcome_ and _Outcome Campus Connect_ as part of the UX team at [Orbis Communications](https://www.orbiscommunications.com), focusing on accessibility and usability for software used by 100+ post-secondary institutions across North America.
