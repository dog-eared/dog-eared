  descriptionBody: "During my co-op terms with Orbis Communications, I generally did UI and UX enhancements across our main product offerings. In my first terms this involved revamping pages to use our in-house UI kit instead of Bootstrap. In my last term I primarily focused on WCAG AA 2.0 compliance, making some of our more complex apps fully accessible to screen-readers and keyboard-only use and in general fixing other a11y issues. These enhancements were felt at over one hundred post-secondaries in both Canada and the United States. I also built prototypes in Vue, ideating on ways to replace our overwhelming number of legacy metrics with more usable dashboards."

  descriptionBody: "While I was at Orbis, I was fortunate to be brought onto a greenfield project to build a job board and student job aggregation systems used Canada-wide. In addition to my normal UX work, I got to extend Charts.js for some custom graphing and integrate Google Maps into a dashboard used to get a high-level overview of where job placements were located."
